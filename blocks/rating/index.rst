Rating
==================

The Rating block may have the most use on community pages, such as Knowledge articles, but can be used on any type of content page or in any page type.

The block has two main uses, which can be in the same block or separately:

1. To make it possible for users to rate the page. Here's an example:

.. image:: rating-block-example.png

A user can click the stars to rate the page. It can be done in half steps or whole steps. A user can only rate a page once, but can change his or her rating anytime.

2. To display average rating. Here's an example of that:

For Knowledge articles, the list "Top rated" uses the average rating to sort the list.
