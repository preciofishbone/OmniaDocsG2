Working with blocks on pages
===============================

This documentation mainly contains general information about how to work with blocks in Design mode on publishing pages (but also see information about Write mode at the bottom).

For more information about how to work with blocks in a page type, see: :doc:`Sections and blocks in page types </pages/page-types/working-with-sections-and-blocks/index>`

1. Edit the page in Design mode.
2. Click on the block that will be before or after the new block so you can se the pluses, and click on the appropriate one (the top one to place the new block above or the bottom one to place the block below).

4. Edit the settings that you want to change.

Copy a block from the clipboard
---------------------------------------------
There's also a clipboard available, that can be used to copy blocks between pages or page types, see: :doc:`Clipboard for sections and blocks </general-assets/layout-explorer/clipboard-sections-blocks/index>`

Display settings for blocks
******************************
When you're working on a block you can select how to show it on different devices, or to not display the block at all on some devices.

Click this icon:

.. image:: device-support-new2.png

Depending on which block it is, there can be some settings available (if not this is empty).

To access the settings, click Enable display breakpoint settings.

.. image:: device-settings-edit-new2.png

The settings are now shown, for example:

.. image:: device-settings.png

You edit the settings the same way as you do in the block's settings, see the description of the block, but here the settings apply specifically to the selected device.

Show the block or not on different devices
-------------------------------------------
Using the LAYOUT settings you can decide on which devices to not show this block at all.

1. Click LAYOUT.
2. Click the pen to change settings.

.. image:: locked-block-new4.png

Unlock a block
*******************
It can be possible to unlock a block, if the page type allow it. If it's possible, the settings can then be edited, but the block can still not be moved or deleted.

If a block can be unlocked, there's a small dot in in the lock icon. Click the lock icon to unlock.

.. image:: block-unlock.png

The following is then shown:

.. image:: block-unlock-unlock.png

If you click OK the settings can be edited for that block.

Editing contents of a block
****************************
To work with blocks as is described above a user needs permissions to use Design mode (Editor). Page authors are not allowed to use Design mode, but can use Write mode to edit the contents of some blocks.
