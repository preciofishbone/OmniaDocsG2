Related links
===========================================

Use this block to add links to related pages or documents in the tenant, or use a custom link to link to any web page. You can also add headings. 

It is possible to add default content to this block and you can set if it should be possible to edit the default content or not. 

If no default content is added, or if editing the default content is allowed, links and headings can be added or edited using Write mode. If default content is added and then locked, nothing can be added to the block.

Here's an example of how users will see related links:
