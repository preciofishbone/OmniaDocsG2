**Note!** When used for advanced search, this block needs a really wide area, more or less the whole page.

Settings for search are set up in Omnia admin, see: :doc:`Business profile Settings - Search </admin-settings/business-group-settings/search/index>`

You can inherit the search settings from the business profile and if that is what you want to do, you don't need to change anything, it's default.

But if you would like to set specific category settings for this block, deselect and the same settings as are available in Omnia admin, for Quick search and Advanced search, will be available (Quick search as an example):
