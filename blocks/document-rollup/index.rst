Document rollup
===========================================

Using The Document rollup block you can display suitable documents in a list. 

For implementation examples, see this page: :doc:`Document rollup implementation examples </blocks/document-rollup/document-rollup-implementation/index>`

Settings
*************************
The following settings are available:

.. image:: document-rollup-settings-all-new3.png

General
-----------------
Here you can set the following:

.. image:: document-rollup-settings-general-new6.png

+ **Title**: If a title should be shown for the block, add it in this field. The title can be added in any, or all tenant languages. Click the flag to change language.
+ **Open in client app**: Documents are by default opened in the online app. If document should be opened in the client app instead, select this option.

Query
---------
You can either choose to pick documents to be displayed in the block, or use the Query Builder.

To pick documents, click "ADD DOCUMENT".

.. image:: document-rollup-pick-new2.png

The document picker opens and you use it to select documents.

See this page for more information on how to use the document picker: :doc:`The Document picker </general-assets//document-picker/index>`

Query builder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here you add queries, which is the detailed "settings" for what to display in the list:

1. Set scope for the document rollup: 

.. image:: document-rollup-settings-query-scope-new2.png

+ **All documents** - always available, meaning ALL documents the logged in user has permissions to read. Use the query settings below to limit what will be shown in the rollup. The rollup can then be set to display just "normal" documents or both normal and controlled documents. To rollup documents from one or more teamsites, use this option.
+ **Published documents**  - available only if the feature Controlled documents is active. Meaning ALL published CONTROLLED DOCUMENTS the logged in user has permissions to read. Use the query settings below to limit what will be shown in the rollup.
+ **Archived documents** - available only if the feature Controlled documents is active. Meaning all published controlled documents in the archive. As permissions to read documents in the archive normally is given to just a few. This is for specialized implementations.

**Note!** Regardless of what you select here, the documents that will be displayed for a user are only those documents that the user has premissions to read.

2. Use the three lists for base settings and the field to add a query parameter. 

.. image:: document-rollup-settings-query-scope-settings.png

3. Click "Add" to add the Query. 

Note that you can type the script directly in the field, if you know how. You can use all options in the Keyword Query Language (KQL). See this Microsoft page for reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/general-development/keyword-query-language-kql-syntax-reference

Additionally you can set:

.. image:: document-rollup-settings-query-scope-settings2.png

+ **Day limit**: Use this option to limit the display of older documents. You first select property (for example Modified) and then select how old the documents can be to be displayed in the list.
+ **Last modified by current user**: Use this option to limit the rollup to documents the logged in user has edited, for example for a "My latest documents" implementation.

A tip - rolling up drafts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you would like to rollup all controlled document drafts in the whole tenant, here's how.

1. Use Query builder.
2. Select "All documents".
3. Add the following KQL: ODMIsPublishedOWSBOOL:0 AND ODMIsPreviewOWSBOOL:0

Like this:

.. image:: rollup-drafts.png

Other filters can of course be used, for example to rollup all draft documents for a specific author or regarding a specific product, as long as you remember to select "All documents".

Display and filter settings are done the usual way.

Click "Adjust refiners" to edit the order.

Using STYLE you can set the following:
