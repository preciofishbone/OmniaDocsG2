Page Rollup
------------------------------------------
It is now possible to create page rollup queries that spans the whole tenant or specific business profiles.

.. image:: pagerollup-tenantbp-scope.png

.. note:: In order to support page rollup queries across publishing apps, three new built-in security groups will replace the current built-in groups.
    
    The new groups are:

    * **Internal Users except restricted**: All internal users except users with mobile-only (Kaizala) limited license.
    * **Internal Users**: All internal users in the organization.
    * **External Users**: All external users including invited guest accounts.
    
    Automatic migration to new groups will be done as follows:

    * "Everyone except external" will be automatically replaced by "Internal Users except restricted".
    * "Everyone" will be replace by "Internal Users" + "External Users" for publishing apps that allow mobile-only access.
    * "Everyone" will be replace by "Internal Users except restricted" + "External Users" for publishing apps that do not allow mobile-only access.

Page statistics is now built into the page rollup. It is possible to display and sort on [Page Hits: All Users],
[Page Hits: Current User] and [Unique Users]. The statistics time period can be limited to one week from today,
two weeks from today or one month from today.

The page rollup can now be used to create editorial dashboards that includes pages that have not been published.
The rollup is security trimmed so that only authors can see pages that have not been published yet.

To further improve the experience for an editor, you can query and display the workflow status of a page.
The workflow status can be "Checked Out", "Pending Publishing", "Scheduled for Publishing" and "Waiting for Approval".

A new switch has been addded to the query part that makes it possible to exclude variations from the rollup.

A new Calendar view is now available for the page rollup block.

A new switch has been added to the page rollup display that makes it possible to export the result to Excel for further analysis.

Teamwork
------------------------------------------

Naming policies are now supported for teamwork templates. A naming policy consists of prefix, suffix and blocked words.

The prefix and suffix can be fixed text and/or dynamic values from the teamwork app properties or the current logged in user.

.. image:: teamwork-naming-policy.png

Besides a naming policy, a teamwork template can be configured with a number of additional policies:

* Minimum no of characters in description: Will not let the user proceed with the teamwork creation without a clear description.
* Minimum no of admins: Forces long-term ownership of the teamwork.
* Default administrators: Makes it possible for central support functions to get ownership of all teamwork by default.
* Sensitivity labels: Makes it possible to apply additional policies using Microsoft compliance features.

the standard services in Microsoft 365 (Teams, Planner, SharePoint etc) and force a structured workflow using Omnia teamwork templates.

Pages can now be moved and copied across page collections within a publishing app.

.. image:: wcm-movecopypage.png

If you need to restructure your information structure, you can use the new Move Page Collection feature.

.. image:: move-page-collection.png

This feature will move a page collection including all pages and resources from one Publishing App to another.

A new feature has been added to the layouts section of blocks that can be used in page types to decide whether the page using
the page type should inherited the settings from the page type or not.

If the block is configured to allow editing the lock, the designer of a page can unlock the block settings and override it with local settings.
