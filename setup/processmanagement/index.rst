Setup Process Management
===========================================

.. note:: In order for Process Managemnet features to appear in the UI, the Process Management feature needs to be activated. Please consult with your local partner to set up these prerequisites.

Below you will find the steps needed in order to create a basic setup of Process Management.

Process Types
--------------------------------------------

1. Go to the SharePoint admin center.
2. Click on Content Services > Term store in the left-hand navigation.
3. Make sure to add the Working Languages that you would like to support in the Document Management System. Note! This is a global setting. It will affect all services dependent on the term store.

In order for the Process Picker to be able to work as expected, the property "Title" must be present in the queryable properties for Process.

Process Archive
-------------------------------------------

.. note:: If you have Document Management setup, you can ignore step 16 - 17.

16. Go to the Business Profile in which you want to host the process archive.
17. Go to Teamwork > Templates and create a new template that can be used for system sites.

(A Publishing Template can be used as well, but using a Teamwork Template is the more common solution).
