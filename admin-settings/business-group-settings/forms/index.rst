Forms
===========

Here you can work with three types of forms. 

.. image:: forms-all-new.png

Surveys has the most options. Polls are similar to surveys but suitable for shorter, simpler forms. Checkups are suitable for micro-courses with knowledge checks.

Settings
********************
Here you can edit the chart colors:

Checking responses
*********************
If responses are available (can be for surveys and polls), you can click this icon to check them:

.. image:: forms-response-icon.png

Here's an example:

.. image:: forms-response-example.png

This is the "Layout view" for the responses. To see one question at a time, click here:

.. image:: forms-response-example-question-by-question.png

Just one question at a time is now shown. You can go from question to question by clicking BACK and NEXT.

.. image:: forms-response-example-question-back-next.png

You can export the responses to Excel for further processing:

.. image:: forms-response-example-excel.png

You can also remove all responses so far, by clicking here:

.. image:: forms-response-example-clear.png

When moving back to the Forms list where you started, don't use the back button in your browser, click the x.

Create a copy of a form
*************************
This can be handy if you are going to create a new form that is simliar to one you already have.

Just click the copy icon for a form, and the following is shown:

.. image:: forms-copy.png

Just click OK and a copy will be created. You can edit settings and work with the graphical presentation, the same way as with any other form, see below.

Create new form
****************
The basic steps for creating a form are the same for all form types, but available settings and options can differ.

Do the following to create a new form:

1. Click the plus, set the settings, and save.
2. Click the pen to edit the graphical presentation, and save.
3. To make a form available for users, add the Form block to a suitable page.

You can find more information about the Form block here: :doc:`Form block </blocks/blocks-forms/form/index>`

When you create a new form, the graphical presentation is opened when you click Save for the settings. (When you edit settings for an existing form, it's not).

Settings
***********
The settings are the same for all form types. All settings you use when creating a form are available when editing (but not all can be changed for all types of forms).

Working with the graphical presentation
****************************************
It can look like this (survey as an example):

.. image:: surveys-1.png

As you can see, there are some similarities to working with pages. For example, the layout explorer is available here. 

.. image:: surveys-layout-explorer.png

See this for more information: :doc:`Layout explorer </general-assets/layout-explorer/index>`

Also similar to working with pages, there is a Design mode and a Preview mode (but no Write mode, because it's not needed here).

.. image:: surveys-mode.png

General settings
------------------
The general settings for the graphical presentation are found here:

.. image:: forms-settings-graphical.png

Use the left-most icon to select a canvas size (workspace area):

.. image:: forms-settings-graphical-workspace.png

Use the icon in the middle to set colors:

.. image:: forms-settings-graphical-colors.png

Use the right-most icon to set padding:

.. image:: forms-settings-graphical-padding.png

Working with sections and blocks
-----------------------------------
You can use all general sections and blocks when working with the graphical presentation, and you use the settings the normal way. Click a blue plus to add a section, a black plus to add a block.

**A tip!** The Stepper section can be very useful for forms.

You can find more information about how to work with sections here: :doc:`Working with sections and blocks </pages/page-types/working-with-sections-and-blocks/index>`

Information about sections settings is found here: :doc:`Settings for sections </pages/page-types/section-settings/index>`

More information about how to work with blocks is found here: :doc:`Working with blocks </blocks/working-with-blocks/index>`

When working with the a form's graphical presentation, a specific block is available - Form question. You can find more information about that block here: :doc:`The Form question block </blocks/blocks-forms/form-question/index>`.

As always, don't forget to save when you're finished:
