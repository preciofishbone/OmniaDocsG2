Process types
==================

When an author creates a process he or she selects a process type. A process type consists of a property set, one or more process templates and settings for how publishing, review and archive should be handled for the process.

Before you continue here, make sure all process templates you will need has been created, see: :doc:`Process templates </admin-settings/tenant-settings/process-management/process-templates/index>`

Also see to that the property set you need has been created, see: :doc:`Property sets </admin-settings/tenant-settings/properties/property-sets/index>`

+ **Process Templates**: Select one or more process templates for the process author to choose from.

+ **Allow Revisions**: Selecting this option you can allow authors to publish a revision of a process, instead of a full edition, for example for correcting typing errors. 
+ **Allow to bypass approval for Revisions**: If this option is active (shown when the option above is selected), it's up to the author to decide if approval is needed or not, when publishing a revision. Approval is still needed for publishing a new (full) edition of a process.
+ **Publishing approval**: Select if approval is to be used for this Process Type. If this option is NOT active, a process will be published immediately when an author clicks "Publish". If Publishing Approval is selected, you must also choose how approval will take place:

+ **Anyone**: The author can select any user of the portal as approver, when the process is published.
+ **Limited list of users**: Authors can select approvers from a defined list only. You create the list here.
+ **Term-driven**: Authors can select approvers from a defined list only. Which approvers will be available depends on the Properties selected for the process. You select the term(s) here. When you have selected one or more terms you can use the cogwheel to set approvers for individual terms in the set.
+ **Based on person property**: You select one of the person properties defined, for example Process owner.

Save when you're done here.

Select which role will recieve the reminders. The feedback will also be availble on the Published tab in the site where the process is edited.
+ **Review Reminder**: Select this option if a review reminder should be sent for the process. If this option is selected, you must also set the following:
+ *Time after publishing*: You can set how often a review reminder should be sent, in one of two ways. Here you can set a time span - a number of days, months or years.
+ *Property*: You can set how often a review reminder should be sent, in one of two ways. Here you can set a property for that purpose, a property a process author will fill in - a specific date or a specific retention date.
+ *Send reminder in advance*: The reminder can be sent a number of days, months or years before the decided revision date. Set how far in advance it will be sent here.
