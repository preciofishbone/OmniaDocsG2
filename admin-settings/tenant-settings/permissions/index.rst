Permissions for the tenant
============================

The following settings are found here:

.. image:: security-tenant-v75.png

Users and groups
******************* 
Use this setting to add and remove tenant administrators and separate administrators for shared links and snnouncements, if needed. Only tenant administrators can use this setting. A tenant administrator can also edit all the settings for all business profiles within the tenant.

To delete an administrator in any of the lists, just click the x. To add an administrator, add the name the same way as in other name fields.

**Note!** There must always be at least one tenant administrator. If there is only one, that administrator can not be removed until an additional administrator has been added.

If you see a field called "Entra ID username", it's a special case that can be necessary to handle when setting up a new tenant. It's because the user sync can't be executed until the tenant has been setup.

Event Management service account

If you will be using Event Management with a connection to calendars in Outlook, you must add the service account that will be used to read and write from the calendars in the tenant. (Don't forget that this account needs permissions to that calendar.)
