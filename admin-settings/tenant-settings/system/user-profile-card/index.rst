User Profile Card
===================

**This page is being updated. Will be finishad soon.**

The user profile card will be shown (if this functionality is activated) whenever you click on a user name in Omnia. The user profile card is designed to align with user profile cards in other services in Microsoft 365.

Here's how a profile card can look:

**Note!** In Omnia on-prem, all options referring to Delve is removed, as it's a Microsoft 365 feature and therefore not available on-prem.

The user profile card also includes the possibility to browse who reports to who in the organization. Here's an example:
