Dynamic Groups
=============================================

This option is available in Omnia 7.0 and later.

Here dynamic groups can be created, edited and deleted. Dynamic security groups are based on user types, not on membership. They will replace and expand on the built-in groups “Internal users” and “External users” and can be used to protect information.

The user types are those created in User Management, see: :doc:`User Types </admin-settings/tenant-settings/user-management/user-types/index>`

Use the pen to edit settings for a group, the dust bin to delete it.
