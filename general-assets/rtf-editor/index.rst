Editing text with the RTF Editor
=====================================

When editing text in Omnia, a RTF editor can be available. What is available in the editor is set up in Omnia Admin, and in a few cases in the block itself.

**Note!** Options available in the RTF Editor can differ a lot, depending on how it's set up. Not all options described below may be available.

For more information about the settings, see: :doc:`RTF Editor Settings </admin-settings/tenant-settings/settings/rtf-editor/index>`

Using the RTF Editor

Here's all of the options that may be available in the editor, as of Omnia 7.1:

There are two lists and a number of icons available. You use the flag to note the language for the text you're entering. 

You point at an icon for a tool tip. Here's an example:

Some options are also available as a floating toolbar, when text is selected, for example Add Link, Keep Text Only and OpenAI (if available):

The image/video area fills up the whole width (same width as the text), the height/width ratio intact. Some tools also becomes available. Here's an example for a photo:

.. image:: rtf-add-image-tools-width-1-v7.png

The following is shown:

You can also set an exact width in pixels by selecting "Fixed Width".

Pasting text only
-------------------
A well known problem when pasting text from other sources into an HTML environment is that styles and the like from the original text does not work - or is not wanted. To make that problem go away, you can paste the text as Text only.

All style tags are removed. Default HTML styles is kept.

.. image:: rtf-editor-test-only-v7.png

You can also use this option on text you already have in the block. Just select the text and the option becomes available.

Pasting contents from Microsoft Word
-------------------------------------
When pasting contents from a Microsoft Word document into a Rich Text field, some of the text formats can also be pasted. Headings are also regornized and the RTF Editor settings for these headings are applied. 

Note that bold, underscore and headings are considered default HTML styles and will be kept, with the RTF Editor settings, even when pasting text only is selected.

Images from the Word document are also pasted, if you select them. Note that this apply to Rich Text fields (blocks) only. It does not work for plain text.

Add an anchor (bookmark)
---------------------------
Anchors can be used in the Add Link general asset and when creating a link button using the Action button block. So, if you add an anchor (bookmark) to the text, links can be created to that anchor.

Here's how to add an anchor:

1. Type the text.
2. Select the text where the anchor should be placed.

For more information about the Action button block, see: :doc:`Action button </blocks/button-link/index>`

Using Machine Translation
---------------------------
If the option is available you can machine translate the text in a block, this way:

1. Click the icon.

.. image:: rtf-editor-machine-translation-v7.png

2. Select the language to translate to.

.. image:: machine-translation-select-language-v7.png

Any language can be selected here. The languages set up in Omnia Admin are shown at the top of the list. To select another language, select "Show all Languages" at the bottom of the list.

.. image:: machine-translation-select-language-all-v7.png

**Note!** You can use Ctrl-Z or just Discard Changes if you change your mind.

Using OpenAI
-----------------
If available, you can use OpenAI to suggest changes to the text, or maybe even to suggest some text for you.

If OpenAI is available, you use the following icon to start the option:

.. image:: openai-icon.png

If you select a part of the text, it's also available on the floating toolbar:

.. image:: openai-icon-floating.png

Here's how to use it:

1. Click the icon to process the whole text, or select part of the text and then click the icon to only process that part.
2. Choose what to do.

What is available here can differ greatly, if available at all. It's fully up to administrators to set up in Omnia Admin. Here's an example:

.. image:: openai-options.png

3. Select option.
4. Check OpenAIs suggestion and edit if needed (or cancel the whole suggestions with Ctrl-Z).

If a Custom option is available (can be named something else) you can ask OpenAI to do more or less anything you like (with text that is).

The chat window, which can be called something else, can look this way:

.. image:: openai-chat.png

You can ask OpenAI to do any changes to the text, or create new text, by using "normal" conversation. Just try it out, what will be saved is totally up to you.

In this example the author was thinking about adding a section about the central railway station in Stockholm, but didn't know what it was called. So he simply asked OpenAI that.

HTML
------
If it's available, you can work with the HTML Code, if you know how. When you click the icon a separate window is opened, where you do your HTML work.
