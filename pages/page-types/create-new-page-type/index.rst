Create a new Page Type
========================

To create a new page type when you're editing a page, do the following.

Note that if your organization works with Tenant Page Types you first have to consider if you should add it as a Tenant Page Type or a Local Page Type. For more information, see this page: :doc:`Tenant Page Types </admin-settings/tenant-settings/webcontent-managament/page-types/index>`

1. Click the plus for Page Types.

3. Now start to build the the base layout by adding sections. Note that there are a number of Layout Templates you can use as a starting point (see to the right).

See the images on the icons for the layouts, for a simple preview of the layout.

For a description of the section settings, see: :doc:`Section settings </pages/page-types/section-settings/index>`

5. You then add blocks for the page's content.
