Move one or several pages
===========================================

You can always easily move a page to another position on the same level (within the parent node). By using the navigation tree, you can move a node (one page or a page with all sub pages) to any position in the navigation tree, even to other page collections within the publishing app. 

Move a page on the same level
******************************
