Edit a process in Omnia v7
================================================

This page describes how this works in Omnia 7.0 and later.

To edit a draft process, just click the title in the list, or select "Edit" in the process's dot menu.

If you click the process title, the process is shown in Preview mode. You have to click EDIT to edit the process.

If you select EDIT in the dot menu, the process is opened in Design mode.

The same options are available when you edit a draft process as when creating one, see all options here: :doc:`Working with draft processes </working-with-processes-v7/authoring-processes-v7/working-with-drafts-processes/index>`

If the process is published you will have to create a new draft from the published edition, to be able to edit the process, see: :doc:`Create a new draft from a published process </working-with-processes-v7/authoring-processes-v7/working-with-drafts-processes/create-new-draft-from-published-process/index>`
