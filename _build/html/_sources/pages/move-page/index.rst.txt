Move a page
===========================================

You can always move a page to another position on the same level (within the parent node). 

It's also possible to move a node (one page or a page with all sub pages) to any position in the navigation tree, even to other page collections within the publishing app. See this page for more information: :doc:`Edit Page Navigation </pages/edit-page-navigation/index>`

Do the following to move a page within the same level:

1. Open the page in Design mode.

The navigation structure with the existing pages are now opened to the left:

If you're already editing the page or the navigation won't open automatically, you can click here to open the navigation:

2. Select the page you want to move.
