These settings has been made for the first step:

.. image:: tutorial-example-2-new2.png

and these settings for the second step:

.. image:: tutorial-example-3-new2.png

and these for the third:

.. image:: tutorial-example-4-new2.png

The tutorial is targeted to the start page and will start automatically:

In the Navigation Bar for the Workspace, for the Business Profile, it has been set that tutorials should be available in the Action Menu. The option is shown where a tutorial is available, but not shown otherwise.

As it is an introduction that should be available for everyone, it's not targeted.

The user experience
----------------------
In this example, the tutorial starts automatically the first time the user enters the start page. If a user would like to see the tutorial a second time, it can be started from the Action Menu:

Or by clicking an Action Button on the start page itself (set up in an Action Button block):

The steps will be shown for users this way:

Users can navigate the tutorial using the dots or the arrows:
