General Block Settings
===========================================

The Layout tab contains settings that are general for most blocks, but scoped for each block. 

Adding filters to a block, if it's possible, works the same for most blocks. Find a general description of how to do that here: :doc:`Filter UI </blocks/general-block-settings/filters/index>`

The Layout tab contain the following settings:

+ **Icon Type**: If you would like an icon to be shown for the block, the first step is to select icon type. (If you don't select an icon, Icon Type has no effect).
+ **Icon**: After having selected icon type, then select the icon.
+ **Custom settings**: For Header you can choose to use the global settings (set up in Omnia Admin) or use Custom Settings for this block.

Available custom settings for TEXT:

You can set these custom settings, for STYLE:

.. image:: layout-header-custom-style.png

+ **Follow Theming**: Select this to follow the theming you selected under Theming. If you don't you can select a custom background color.

The rest of the options should be self explanatory.

And these settings are available for ICON:

You can just try out different settings and see the effect in the block.

Targeting
************
A lot of blocks can be targeted to one or more groups using Targeting Properties. 

To target a block, open the settings for the block and select "Add Targeting Filter".

You set up targeting for a block, if available, the same way as in many other parts of Omnia. See this page for more information: :doc:`Using Targeting </general-assets/targeting-in-omnia/index>`
